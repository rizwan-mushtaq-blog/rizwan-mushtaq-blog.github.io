      <description>The aim of this short paper is to predict the financial literacy levels of US households.
  Financial literacy is defined as the knowledge of basic financial concepts.
  For that purpose, I use survey data sets provided by FINRA from 2009 to 2018.
  I used all the surveys conducted so far that include (108310) number of households in the US.
  I examine whether we can predict financial literacy level of the participant based on their demographic, education and profession ?</description>
